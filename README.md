# Set Implementation in Python
This project implements different set algorithms in Python, and compares their performances. For more information, please check out ![my blog post](http://jeenalee.com/blog_entries/2.html).

### Algorithms
Currently, there are 3 set algorithms written: sorted list, unsorted list, and unbalanced tree. The unbalanced tree is written recursively, and it will reach the Python's recursion limit. Refactoring the code is under development.

### Visualization
The benchplot.R will generate plots that compare the different set algorithms. Please make sure to set the working directory, and change the file name to open to match yours.
